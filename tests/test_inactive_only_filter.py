"""
Issue #169: /members/?include_inactive=true was the plain complement
of "deleted_at IS NULL" -- i.e. every non-deleted member, active ones
included -- rather than actually filtering to inactive members only.
The real complement of active_member_filter() is an OR (either half
failing makes a member inactive), not the AND active_member_filter()
itself uses.

A member with a blank member_since/member_until (still "active" per
active_member_filter(), unchanged -- see tests/test_upcoming_members.py)
must NOT show up here, even though such members do show up in the
separate pending_only view (issue #167 follow-up) -- these two filters
serve different purposes and are deliberately not the same population.
