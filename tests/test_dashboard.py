"""
Issue #196: the dashboard's "quick access" card exposed admin-only
functionality to every logged-in user. "Manage users" was already
gated to `is_system_admin`, but the API docs (Swagger) link had no
gate at all, so a plain board member saw a shortcut to internals that
belong in the administration area. Both links were removed from the
quick access card; the API docs link was added to the admin sidebar's
"Administration" nav group instead (also `is_system_admin`-gated).
