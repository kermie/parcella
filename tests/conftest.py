"""
Central test configuration.

Important: DATABASE_URL is set HERE, right at the start, BEFORE any app
import. Python caches module imports -- if app.database (and thus the
engine/session) was already imported once with the production URL,
every later import would reuse that same (wrong) connection. Since we
set os.environ first and only import the app AFTERWARDS, the app's own
internal mechanisms (middleware, startup logic) automatically use the
test database too -- without us having to override every single spot
individually.

Tests deliberately run against real PostgreSQL, not SQLite: several
past bugs in this project only occurred with PostgreSQL (e.g. enum
value casing) -- SQLite would have made these bugs invisible instead of
catching them.
