"""
Print channel for the announcements module: renders a one-page,
branded PDF notice from an Announcement, meant for physical posting
on the allotment grounds.

Shares its page chrome (header/footer/@page, "Page X of Y") with every
other PDF in this app via app/pdf_chrome.py -- see that module's
docstring and docs/ADR/0045 for why (it was originally left out as a
differently-shaped single-page document, then brought in line on
request). Still always exactly one page -- the shortening loop below is
unaffected, it just now also shows "Page 1 of 1" like every other
document instead of no page number at all.

Renders once with the full text (the manual print_text_override if the
admin set one, otherwise the full body). If that fits on one page,
done. If not, shortens paragraph-by-paragraph and re-renders each
attempt, stopping at the first one that fits -- adding a "read the
rest online" note with a QR code, but only once shortening actually
happened (untouched text never gets a QR code slapped on it) and only
if the WordPress draft has genuinely been published (see
app.blog_publisher.WordPressPublisher.get_public_url_if_published --
there's nothing public to point a QR code at until then, so the note
is simply omitted, not shown with a broken link).

If even a single paragraph still doesn't fit alongside the header,
footer, and image, generation stops and raises PrintTooLongError
rather than silently producing a multi-page "one-pager" or truncating
mid-sentence -- per the original design decision to ask a human in
that case.

The shortened text, once found, is written back onto
announcement.print_text_override so it's visible and freely editable
afterward, and so regenerating the PDF later doesn't have to redo the
same search.
