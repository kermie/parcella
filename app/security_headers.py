Security-related HTTP response headers.

The app previously sent none of these, which mattered more here than in
a typical server-rendered app because user-uploaded files are served
from the SAME origin as the UI (/static/uploads/: avatars, announcement
images, and the club logo -- which is allowed to be an SVG, and an SVG
opened directly runs its own script).

The CSP is deliberately not maximal. Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons come
from jsdelivr (see base.html), and the templates carry inline <style>
blocks and inline <script> blocks, so 'unsafe-inline' has to stay for
now -- removing it means nonce-ing every inline block, which is a
separate, much larger change. What the policy DOES buy today:
  * no script may be loaded from anywhere except this origin and the
    one pinned CDN -- an injected <script src> to an attacker host is
    dead on arrival,
  * form-action 'self' stops an injected <form> from posting a member's
    data (or an admin's) off-site,
  * frame-ancestors 'none' + X-Frame-Options makes clickjacking of the
    admin panel impossible,
  * object-src 'none' and base-uri 'self' close the two classic
    injection escapes.

HSTS is only sent outside development: sending it from a local http://
instance would pin the browser to https://localhost for months.
