"""
A unified, filterable list of every invoice payment across the club
(issue #180) -- money actually received against an outgoing Invoice,
and money actually paid against an IncomingInvoice, combined into one
chronological list. Complements the per-account "bookings" view
(issue #174, app/routers/finances.py's _account_bookings_base) which
is scoped to one FinanceAccount and includes AccountTransaction rows;
this one is club-wide and scoped to invoice payments only.

AccountTransaction is deliberately excluded here too, same reasoning
as the cash-based accounting statement's ADR 0060: it has neither a
sender/recipient nor a category, so it doesn't fit this list's
sender/recipient/category/description shape any better than it fit
the statement's category breakdown.

Built entirely in Python rather than a SQL UNION ALL (contrast with
_account_bookings_base) because each payment can touch several
categories via its invoice's line items -- a one-to-many relationship
that doesn't collapse cleanly into one UNION'd row. Fine at the scale
a garden club actually operates at; revisit with a real pagination/
SQL-level approach if that assumption ever stops holding.
