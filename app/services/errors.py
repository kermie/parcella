"""
Shared exception type for app/services/* business-rule violations.

Formalizes the (translation_key, params) shape app/meter_utils.py's
check_monotonicity() already used informally into one reusable type.
A service raises this instead of an HTTPException directly, so it stays
framework-agnostic (no FastAPI/Jinja2 concerns) -- each router (HTML or
API) resolves the message via its own means (t_for(request, ...) for
both, since sprache_middleware runs for API requests too) and applies
its own status-code convention (HTML: 400, API: 422 -- deliberately not
unified, see ADR 0070).
