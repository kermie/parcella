"""
Shared purchase-request business logic, called by both
app/routers/purchase_requests.py (HTML) and
app/routers/api_purchase_requests.py (API) -- see ADR 0070.

Four-eyes principle: two different board members must agree before a
PurchaseRequest counts as approved; the requester themselves may not
give either approval; a single rejection vetoes it. This is this
project's own documented highest-regression-risk area (see
docs/testing.md) -- what's shared here is deliberately narrow: only the
one rule that must never be bypassable regardless of caller (the
self-approval block) and the approval-counting/auto-transition logic.
The "already handled" short-circuits (not OPEN, already approved by
this user) stay in each router, since HTML and API already handled
those cases differently on purpose (HTML redirects silently, API
409s) -- unifying that wasn't broken, so it isn't touched.

Two real divergences found and fixed along the way:
1. Approval authority is deliberately narrower than ordinary module
   write access (see docs/module-purchase-requests.md) -- HTML's
   require_admin is Group-aware (ADMIN/BOARD role, or a
   grants_full_access/grants_system_admin group); the API's
   require_vorstand_api was role-only. The reverse-direction version of
   ADR 0071's TREASURER bug: here the API was *stricter* than HTML, not
   looser. Fixed via a new require_api_full_access (app/api_auth.py).
2. The API's confirmation email for an external (non-login) requester
   never actually included the confirmation link/button -- it told the
   requester to "log in", which they have no account to do. Fixed by
   sharing the same email content (incl. the actual link) HTML already
   built correctly.
